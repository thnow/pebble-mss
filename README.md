Version: 1.1.0
Published: 5/16/2026
Release Notes:
* Fix for watchface getting messed up when Timeline Peek gets triggered on Pebble Time 2
* Moved digits on Pebble Time 2, to be further away from edge of screen
* Added new handling of step/sleep icon, so that it matches the color of the sub clock text
* (Possible) Fix for up/down arrow in health always pointing down

Notice: There is still an issue with the up/down arrow of sleep/steps. It might be related to a bug in the current new pebble app. I'm testing some things out that I'm done with yet, but decided that since it dosn't work currently, i might as well release this now

## Local development

This repository can use a project-local Python environment for the Pebble CLI:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements-dev.txt
```

VS Code is configured to use `.venv/bin/python` and to put `.venv/bin` on the integrated terminal `PATH`.

Useful VS Code tasks:

- `Pebble: SDK install 4.5`
- `Pebble: build`
- `Pebble: install on PT2 emulator`
- `Pebble: open app config on PT2 emulator`
- `Pebble: logs from PT2 emulator`
- `Pebble: screenshot from PT2 emulator`

Press `F5` in VS Code and select `Pebble: Run on PT2 emulator` to build and install the watchface on the Pebble Time 2 emulator.
